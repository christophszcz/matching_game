## Matching Game

[See it live](http://christophszcz.github.io/matching_game/)

This is a game that divides the webpage into two sides. Both sides have the same images although the left side always has one more image than the right. The objective involves clicking the image on the left side that is missing from the right. This game gets progressively harder as the number of images will increase by 5 as the correct missing image is selected.
